# room-temp-sensors
This is a modification of the original code to replace pressure with heatindex calculations
+ Added support for gas sensor MQ135

Original code by : https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp8266-nodemcu-mqtt-publish-bme280-arduino/



# Prerequisites

You need to setup a MQTT Broker on the same network as your esp8266

# How to setup
Make sure u have Git installed then run
"git clone https://github.com/KATT07/room-temp-sensors"
Then open the file in Arduino IDE
goto Sketch > Include Library > Add . ZIP library and select the libraries youâ€™ve just downloaded.
For BME280 need to add the Adafruit BME280 library with dependencies in arduino software
For MQ135 need to add the MQ135 library in same folder as the code.ino : https://github.com/GeorgK/MQ135
